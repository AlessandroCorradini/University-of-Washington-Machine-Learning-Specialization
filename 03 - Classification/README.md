# Machine Learning: Classification from University of Washington

## Overview
[Machine Learning: Classification from University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification) is an introductory/intermediate course for the Machine Learning world in Python and in a practical approach.

The entire specialization is taught by the Amazon Professors of Machine Learning Carlos Guestring and Emily Fox on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

This course covers:

- Describe the input and output of a classification model.
- Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
- Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  
- Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
- Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
- Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
- Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  
- Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  
- Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
- Use techniques for handling missing data.
- Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
- Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).
