# Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval from University of Washington

## Overview
[Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval from University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval) is an introductory/intermediate course for the Machine Learning world in Python and in a practical approach.

The entire specialization is taught by the Amazon Professors of Machine Learning Carlos Guestring and Emily Fox on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

This course covers:

- Create a document retrieval system using k-nearest neighbors.
- Identify various similarity metrics for text data.
- Reduce computations in k-nearest neighbor search by using KD-trees.
- Produce approximate nearest neighbors using locality sensitive hashing.
- Compare and contrast supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- Cluster documents by topic using k-means.
- Describe how to parallelize k-means using MapReduce.
- Examine probabilistic clustering approaches using mixtures models.
- Fit a mixture of Gaussian model using expectation maximization (EM).
- Perform mixed membership modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
- Describe the steps of a Gibbs sampler and how to use its output to draw inferences.
- Compare and contrast initialization techniques for non-convex optimization objectives.
- Implement these techniques in Python.
