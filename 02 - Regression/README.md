# Machine Learning: Regression from University of Washington

## Overview
[Machine Learning: Regression from University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression) is an introductory/intermediate course for the Machine Learning world in Python and in a practical approach.

The entire specialization is taught by the Amazon Professors of Machine Learning Carlos Guestring and Emily Fox on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

This course covers:

- Describe the input and output of a regression model.
- Compare and contrast bias and variance when modeling data.
- Estimate model parameters using optimization algorithms.
- Tune parameters with cross validation.
- Analyze the performance of the model.
- Describe the notion of sparsity and how LASSO leads to sparse solutions.
- Deploy methods to select between models.
- Exploit the model to form predictions. 
- Build a regression model to predict prices using a housing dataset.
- Implement these techniques in Python.
