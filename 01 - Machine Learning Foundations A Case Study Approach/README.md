# Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach from University of Washington

## Overview
[Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach from University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations) is an introductory/intermediate course for the Machine Learning world in Python and in a practical approach.

The entire specialization is taught by the Amazon Professors of Machine Learning Carlos Guestring and Emily Fox on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

This course covers:

- Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
- Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
- Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
- Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
- Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
- Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
- Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
- Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
- Implement these techniques in Python.
